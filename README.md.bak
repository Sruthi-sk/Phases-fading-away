# Phases fading away
We (Sruthi, Aiswary and myself) met Dr. Nir Grossman at EMBO Lecture course on `Neuromodulation` at IIT Gandhinagar and he walked us through endpoint Hilbert method

## This repo aims to understand what he taught us in detail
- If the start and end of the sample are not continuous with each other, distortions are introduced by the DFT
- Echt effectively smooths out this 'discontinuity' by selectively deforming the start of the sample
- We wanted to capture realtime data from EEG, run filter-Hilbert to find the instantaneous phase and trigger sound if the phase is of certain value
- Since the conventional method distorts phases at the end point, we need to fix this

- The redboxes are distortions! Damn
- I created sine waves which have different phases at starts and ends
- Such waveforms subjected to Hilbert distorts phases
- I had waveforms which starts and ends with same phases, where this issue is not there
- Gibbs Gibbs Gibbs :bomb:
